# AJ-Squid-ACL-Helper
This is a single acl helper, compatible with big black lists, just to match urls with acls, keep use of other squid config, like http_access, and other matchs acls in default config.
This keep centralized config in squid with high performance and no reload for new urls, nice to big lists ^_^.
